                <p> I'm currently a second-year mathematics graduate student at Oregon State University. I grew up in suburban Takoma Park, Maryland, I lived in Kodaikanal, India for a couple of years, and I have lived permanently in Berea, Kentucky since then. I got my undergraduate degree at Kalamazoo College, where I studied math, philosophy, and German. <br> <br> <br>
                
                <h2>My work</h2>
                My work as a math grad student has involved both research and teaching components. As a researcher, I've begun working with Dr. Malgorzata Peszynska, my PhD advisor, in numerical analysis. In layman's terms, numerical analysis involves estimating stuff using a computer. Generally, the process involves
                <ol>
                    <li> Finding a problem in an applied field like physics, chemistry, etc. This requires knowledge of the relevant topics in the applied field of choice.</li>
                    <li> Phrasing the problem in the language of mathematics.</li>
                    <li> Finding and implementing an algorithm to estimate a solution the mathematical problem (this is called "solving the problem numerically"). This requires knowledge of computing and algorithms. </li>
                    <li> Using the tools of math and logic to prove that the estimate is close to the true solution. This requires knowledge of mathematical reasoning and the relevant mathematical concepts.</li>
                </ol>
                In my experience, the problems I've been trying to solve have often involved partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, I have worked on numerically solving a system of coupled PDEs, as well as numerically solving an optimization problem under constraints. <br> <br> <br>

                As an educator, I work as a graduate teaching assistant (GTA). Each term, I work with a full-time instructor at the university on a course they are teaching. Generally, this involves grading assignments and holding problem-solving reciation sessions. I also serve as a tutor in the University's Mathematics and Statistics Learning Center (MSLC), which is a drop-in tutoring center which helps all mathematics and statistics courses held at the University. <br> <br> <br>
                
                <h2>My personal interests</h2>
                My personal interests are really varied. They include
                <ul>
                    <li>Petting cats,</li>
                    <li>Seeing and exploring nature (especially Appalachia),</li>
                    <li>Doing/reading/discussing math, logic, and philosophy,</li>
                    <li>Watching movies and listening to music.</li>
                </ul>
