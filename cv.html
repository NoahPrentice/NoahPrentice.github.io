                    As I mentioned on the home page, I currently work in Corvallis, Oregon (pictured above) as a mathematics graduate student and graduate teaching assistant at Oregon State University. My most recent CV (updated 1/11/2025) reflects this work:

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    I received my high school diploma in 2019 from Berea Community High School in Berea, Kentucky. There, I took as many Honors and AP courses as I could, and I really began to develop interests in a variety of subjects, including math, English, economics, and physics. In the end, though, math was my favorite subject. I have no doubt that this was in large part because of Mrs. Linda Williams, who was always incredibly encouraging and engaging. To this day, she still comes to mind as one of the best teachers I've had, and she is the main reason I am studying math now.<br> <br>
                    
                    Largely due to the financial aid I was provided, I ended up going to college at Kalamazoo College (K) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In my first few terms there, I was planning on majoring in math and physics while taking German courses to fulfill the foreign language requirement. I ended up loving the German courses and professors, so I decided to major in German, too. Eventually, I lost interest in physics and replaced it with philosophy&mdash;and I haven't looked back since! <br> <br>
                    
                    At K, I had many instructors who played pivotol roles in my life. In the German department, I owe a great deal to Dr. Kathryn Sederberg, Dr. Michael Powers, and Dr. Petra Watzke for pushing everyone to improve while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. Along similar lines, Dr. Eric Barth and Dr. Stephen Oloo were integral in the development of my math education. Then, in philosophy, I owe more than 3/4 of my knowledge and success to Dr. Lars Enden, who is now a dear friend of mine. <br> <br>
